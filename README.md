# Django E-Commerce Backend

A scalable, modern e-commerce backend built with Django, PostgreSQL, and Docker. This setup includes development tooling for linting, formatting, and other common development tasks via Makefile.

## Features

- 🧱 Built with Django and PostgreSQL
- 🐳 Fully Dockerized with Docker Compose
- 🧰 Code quality tools: `flake8`, `black`, `isort`
- 🛠️ Convenient Makefile for managing development tasks
- 🏗️ Modular architecture for easy scalability

## Project Structure

```
ecom/
├── .flake8                # Flake8 linting configuration
├── Dockerfile             # Dockerfile for the web service
├── docker-compose.yml     # Docker Compose configuration (web + db services)
├── Makefile               # Development commands
├── requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
├── manage.py              # Django management script

│   └── wsgi.py
└── apps/                  # Modular Django apps (to be added)
```

## Prerequisites

- Docker (with Docker Compose v2)
- Make (pre-installed on most systems)

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repository-url.git
   cd your-project-directory
   ```

2. Build and start the services (Django + PostgreSQL):

   ```bash
   make up
   ```

   This will build the Docker images, start the containers, and apply migrations.

3. Visit the Django app at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Useful Makefile Commands

| Command                | Description                             |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `make up`              | Build and start the containers          |
| `make down`            | Stop and remove the containers          |
| `make logs`            | Show logs from the running containers   |
| `make makemigrations`  | Create new migrations                   |
| `make migrate`         | Apply migrations to the database        |
| `make shell`           | Open Django shell inside the container  |
| `make lint`            | Run flake8 for linting                   |
| `make format`          | Auto-format code using black & isort    |
| `make runserver`       | Run Django’s development server inside Docker |
| `make runserver-local` | Run Django’s development server locally |

## Database

This project uses PostgreSQL, which is defined in `docker-compose.yml`. The default credentials are:

- **DB Name**: `ecom`
- **User**: `ecom_user`
- **Password**: `secret`

These can be modified as needed in `docker-compose.yml`.

## Tooling

### Linting and Formatting

- **Flake8**: Code linting for identifying issues in the code.
- **Black**: Code formatting to enforce consistent style.
- **isort**: Import sorting for cleaner code.

### Running Linters & Formatters

To lint the codebase, run:

```bash
make lint
```

To auto-format the codebase, run:

```bash
make format
```

## Next Steps

1. Start adding Django apps inside the `apps/` directory (e.g., `users`, `products`, `orders`).
2. Implement features such as authentication, product management, shopping cart, and payments.
3. Set up a production environment (e.g., with Gunicorn, Nginx) for deployment.
